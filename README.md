<h1><p>Updated textures for 1.8</p></h1>
<p>This resource pack takes all the textures from 1.17 and makes them compatible with 1.6.1 to 1.8</p>
<p>It was made for the 1.8 PvP community</p>
<p>There are no custom textures - its completly like vanilla 1.17!
<p>All the actual textures have not been modified, some may have had some formatting changes so they appear correctly in game, however <b>all these textures were not made by me, and belong to Mojang</b</p>
